// surface that contrasts with the page", which is near-black in light mode and
// a raised dark grey in dark mode — whereas the old `ink.black` named a colour
// and became a lie the moment a dark palette existed.
//
// Nothing here should be imported for its colour value directly. Components
// read the active palette through useTheme()/useThemedStyles so a theme change
// re-renders them; a module-scope `StyleSheet.create` captures values once at
// import and can never update.

// Scale, spacing and type are theme-independent — only colour has two sets.
