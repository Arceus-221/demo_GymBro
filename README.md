# GymBro

AI-powered fitness coaching for people who don't have a personal trainer budget.
GymBro generates personalized workout plans, estimates meal macros from a plain-language
description, scores daily recovery/readiness, suggests exercise substitutions, and runs
an in-app AI coach chat — all on a **$0 infrastructure budget** (Render free tier +
Firebase free tier + Gemini free tier).

This README is the entry point for the team. Full technical specification lives in
[`/docs`](./docs) as five SRS phases — read them in order if you need the *why* behind
any decision below; this file is the *how do I run it*.

## 1. Architecture at a Glance

GymBro has exactly **two data paths**. Every feature belongs to one of them, and mixing
them up is the most common way to introduce a security bug in this codebase.

```

**Rule of thumb:** if the action is reading/writing *data*, it goes straight from the
app to Firestore (Path A). If the action needs *AI reasoning*, it goes through the
Express backend (Path B) — because the Gemini/OpenRouter/Groq API keys must never exist
inside the Expo app bundle (anyone can decompile an APK and pull a hardcoded key out of
it). The backend's `verifyToken` middleware is the only thing standing between the
public internet and those keys, so every AI route is authenticated with a Firebase ID
token before anything reaches an LLM.

> **Note on current state:** the backend is functionally complete against Phases 1, 2,
> 4, and 5 — all five `/api/ai/*` controllers plus `generate-meal-plan`, the audio
> transcription proxy, the Gemini/OpenRouter provider adapters, the rate limiter, and the
> resilience wrapper are implemented and boot-tested. The `gymbro-app/` frontend now has
> every Phase 3 screen built (auth, 3-step onboarding, dashboard, workout mode, AI coach,
> meal planner, progress) and bundles clean via `npx expo export`. What's still open:
> automated tests on both sides, and an end-to-end run against a real Firebase project.

## 3. Local Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- A Firebase project (Firestore + Auth enabled) — create one for free at
  [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com)
- A Gemini API key (free tier) from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com)
- Expo CLI (`npm install -g expo-cli`) or just use `npx expo`
- Optional: a Groq API key (free tier) if you're working on the voice-note transcription
  fallback

### 3.1 Backend (`gymbro-backend/`)

```bash
cd gymbro-backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in .env with your Firebase service account + Gemini API key
npm run dev
```

Confirm it's alive:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
# {"status":"ok"}
```

Deploy Firestore rules (once, or whenever `firestore.rules` changes):

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools   # one-time
firebase login
firebase use --add              # select your Firebase project
npm run predeploy               # runs `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
```

### 3.2 Frontend (`gymbro-app/`)

Expo SDK 57, expo-router, plain JavaScript. Already scaffolded — just install and run:

```bash
cd gymbro-app
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
cp .env.example .env.local
# Fill in .env.local with your Firebase web config + backend URL
npx expo start
```

Scan the QR code with Expo Go, or press `i` / `a` for a simulator.

> `--legacy-peer-deps` is needed because expo-router pulls in a `react-dom` whose peer
> range is a patch ahead of the `react` version Expo SDK 57 pins. It's inert for a native
> build (nothing imports `react-dom`), but npm's strict resolver refuses the tree without it.

**Firebase SDK choice:** the app uses the **Firebase JS SDK for both Auth and Firestore**,
not `@react-native-firebase`. This is a deliberate deviation from Phase 3 SRS §3.3: the RN
Firebase packages ship native modules, which would force a custom dev build and make
Expo Go unusable. The tradeoff is that Firestore's `persistentLocalCache` is IndexedDB-backed
and therefore unavailable on native — `services/firebase.js` falls back to `memoryLocalCache()`
off web. Live `onSnapshot` reads and offline write queueing still work *within* a session,
but the cache does not survive an app restart. Restoring the SRS's full offline guarantee
means moving to `@react-native-firebase` and building a dev client.

### 3.3 Running Both Together

The app's `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` should point at your local backend
(`http://<your-machine-LAN-IP>:3000` for a physical device, `http://localhost:3000` for
a simulator) during development, and at the deployed Render URL otherwise.

## 4. Free-Tier Engineering

This project deliberately runs on $0 of infrastructure, which forced explicit
engineering decisions a paid stack would have let us skip. Each one is a real
architectural choice, documented in depth in [`docs/GymBro_SRS_Phase_5.md`](./docs/GymBro_SRS_Phase_5.md):

| Constraint | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| **Render free tier sleeps after ~15 min idle** — first request after that pays a 20-50s cold-boot cost | Three layers: an app-launch fire-and-forget wake ping, a client loading-copy swap ("Waking Coach up...") after 4s so the spinner never looks broken, and a GitHub Actions cron hitting `/health` every 10 minutes during expected usage hours |
| **Gemini free tier: 15 RPM / 1,000 RPD / 250K shared TPM** | A single in-process `bottleneck` queue (`maxConcurrent: 1, minTime: 4200ms, highWater: 30, OVERFLOW`) in front of every Gemini call, plus a per-user soft throttle (1 request per 2s) so one client can't starve the shared budget. RPD is a hard wall handled by a proactive daily counter, not retries; TPM is a payload-size concern handled by the fixed `TOKEN_LIMITS` per feature |
| **Vendor lock-in risk** | A one-file provider-adapter interface (`services/aiProviders/`) resolved by a single `AI_PROVIDER` env var — swapping Gemini for OpenRouter (or a paid Gemini tier) touches zero controller code |
| **API key exposure** | Gemini/OpenRouter/Groq keys exist only in `gymbro-backend/.env` / Render's dashboard — never in the Expo bundle. Every AI route requires a verified Firebase ID token before it's reachable at all |

### Standardized AI Error Contract

Every `/api/ai/*` and `/api/audio/*` failure returns the same shape, so the app needs
exactly one error-handling code path:

```json
{ "success": false, "error": "AI_RATE_LIMITED", "message": "..." }
```

| `error` code | HTTP | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `AI_QUEUE_FULL` | 503 | Local request queue is saturated |
| `AI_RATE_LIMITED` | 429 | Gemini RPM ceiling hit |
| `AI_TOKEN_RATE_LIMITED` | 429 | Shared TPM ceiling hit |
| `AI_DAILY_QUOTA_EXCEEDED` | 429 | RPD hard wall — do not retry, "try again tomorrow" |
| `AI_TIMEOUT` | 504 | Gemini call exceeded 30s |
| `AI_PROVIDER_DOWN` | 502 | 5xx from the AI provider |
| `AI_MALFORMED_OUTPUT` | 502 | Valid response but broke schema/JSON parsing |
| `USER_THROTTLED` | 429 | Per-user soft throttle (max 1 req / 2s) |
| `INVALID_REQUEST_BODY` / `INVALID_INPUT_RANGE` | 400 | Zod/range validation failed before any AI call was attempted |

Full detail: [`docs/GymBro_SRS_Phase_2.md` §7](./docs/GymBro_SRS_Phase_2.md), extended in
[Phase 4 §5.5](./docs/GymBro_SRS_Phase_4.md) and [Phase 5 §2.4](./docs/GymBro_SRS_Phase_5.md).

---

## 5. Working Conventions

- **No screen/controller talks to Firestore or Gemini directly.** The app goes through
  `hooks/useFirestoreDoc`, `useFirestoreCollection`, or `useCallBackend`; the backend
  goes through `callGeminiResilient` only. This is what keeps retry/offline/error
  handling centralized in one place instead of five.
- **Every AI system prompt lives in `prompts/`, not inline in the controller.** Keep the
  `<<<USER_INPUT>>> ... <<<END_USER_INPUT>>>` delimiter pattern intact — it's the primary
  defense against prompt injection via free-text fields (meal descriptions, chat
  messages, custom plan instructions).
- **The Gemini model ID lives in exactly one place** — `MODEL_ID` in
  `services/aiProviders/geminiAdapter.js`, which controllers import for
  `generatedByModel` rather than hardcoding. The SRS's `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`
  (and `gemini-2.5-flash`) now return 404 *"no longer available to new users"*,
  so the project runs on `gemini-3.5-flash-lite`. Expect to move again; keep it
  a one-line change.
- **Token budgets are fixed constants** (`CHAT: 1200`, `SUBSTITUTE: 1000`, `RECOVERY: 1000`,
  `PLAN_RESTRUCTURE: 2500`, `MEAL_PLANNER: 4500`) — never pass a raw number to
  `callGemini`/`callGeminiResilient`. Undershooting truncates JSON mid-structure.
- **Plain JavaScript, not TypeScript**, on both sides — JSDoc `@typedef` comments in
  `models/` document shapes for reference; `tsc --checkJs` in CI catches drift without
  requiring a full TS migration.
- **CommonJS on the backend** (`require`/`module.exports`), matching Node 20 + Express
  conventions used throughout the SRS.
- **No live third-party API calls in CI.** Mock `services/aiProviders/*` in tests —
  protects the shared 15 RPM budget and keeps the pipeline deterministic.
